**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The application is a blog that has filtering of each article by author and subject. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Have knowledge of JS and jQuery, research the DOM, have a good working knowledge of console.log and debugger. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The languages used: CSS, HTML, Vanilla JS, jQuery. The library used was jQuery 3.3.1. CSS is used sparingly now that we use jQuery, but certain elements are CSS. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

03-15-18 10:30am - Dropdown is populating
03-15-18 11:30am - filtering is working, the selected element is showing and those not selecetd are hiding.
03-15-18 1:30pm - Blog articles are shortened to teasers, with a functioning read on event. Filtering is also working. 

## Credits and Collaborations
Thanks to the TAs for guiding us into the right direction and pointing out our dumb mistakes and Sarah who helped us understand the $data(content) and the power of the id selectors.
